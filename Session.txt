Hi,

While exploiting using PHP, my sessions are expiring exactly after 30 seconds. 

I'm using php payload to exploit command injection vulnerability.

I even made changes in php.ini to make the session go longer than 30 seconds but still it doesn't work.

I'm getting this error "Meterpreter session is not valid and will be closed."

Please help me resolve this issue. 

Setup Details:

Kali Linux: 5.6.0-kali1-amd64 (last updated on 2020-05-12)
Metasploit: 5.0.89-dev
Victim Machine: owaspbwa 2.6.32-25-generic-pae 
Virtulization Product: VMWare Workstation 15

Output:
A=Attacker
V=Victim
